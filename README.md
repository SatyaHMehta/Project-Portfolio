This is my first attempt at my portfolio. Doing this I have terribly realized that I am not a creative person in terms of designs. I spent, literally, over 24 hours in the last thre days trying to design this. Even though I learned ALOT (this can not be understated) I went through a terrible experiance. Were I to do this again, I would have a proper wire frame and stick to it to the tee. I must have restarted my project atleast 3 times.
